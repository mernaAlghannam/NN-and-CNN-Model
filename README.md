This project is meant to help me better understand concepts of deep learning.
PyTorch and python to create it. <br> <br> <br>

**Neural network with Iris dataset:** <br>
I managed to build a simple NN model with iris dataset and by tweeking the hyperparameters the model has-

prediction accuracy 0.98 <br>
precision 0.98 <br>
recall 0.98 <br> 
**TODO:** I will summarize some NN concepts in the notebook.<br><br>

**Convolutional Neural Network on CIFAR image dataset:** <br>
Trained my model on AlexNet CNN arcitecture, and receieved accuracy of **79%**. This method is called transfer learning. <br>
I created the model with the artitecture that I created and acheived 53% accuracy. It can be better optimized by added more conv layers and augmentation methods. (Can be optimized as a future project) <br>
**TODO:** I will summarize some CNN concepts in the notebook. <br><br>

**Saliency map:** <br>
Created a saliency map from my cnn model to to help visualize the model. <br>
**TODO:** I will summarize some Saliency map concepts in the notebook and other concepts for model interpretibility.<br>
